# Spaceship_Game
Programming language: Python 3.9.0

OS: Windows 10

Package used: keyboard(pip install keyboard)

Run the program:
1. Navigate to the file directory.
2. Input: python gameMaster.py
3. The program will ask the user to input three times
4. Input the height of the grid
5. Input the length of the grid
6. Input the difficult level of the game
7. Play the game. Using left and right button to control '*'.

Note:
1. In the program, I used "os.system('cls')". It's for cleaning the output messages in command window, and it's only valid on Windows system.
2. I used the simplest way to finish the game. The grid would be a two-dimentional list, and every spaces, blocks, and the player are all an element of the list.
